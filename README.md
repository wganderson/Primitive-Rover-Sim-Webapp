# Primitive-Rover-Sim-Webapp

This project consists of a frontend using React and a backend using FastAPI. The functionality includes a resizeable button array to add, edit, and delete mines. The webpage also includes options to add/delete/edit/dispatch a rover and view its path/status. The rover defuses a mine by generating 5 digit codes and verifying the hash against the mines serial code.

The front end is intended for desktop use and does not support a wide range of aspect ratios or device types. Below is a screenshot of the app when opened and then another after some usage.
